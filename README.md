# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app

![Design preview for the Tip calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution to the tip calculator. This challenge is by Frondend Mentor. I made this over a few days during #100DaysOfCode in January 2022.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming applied to CSS classes

### What I learned

I got a lot out of this challenge, the more subtle styles took some fine tuning with the CSS and I got a lot of JavaScript practice. I realise the JavaScript I've used here is not efficient and I have some work and revision to do on JavaScript.
